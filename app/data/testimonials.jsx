			"I was privileged to attend Innovation 2.0 and I must say all I learnt were truly inspiring and helpful. I was able to meet with top person's in the society who have successfully achieved their goals to a desirable point. Listening to them speak helped me plan what I wanted to achieve last year. I met with the youngest ECOWAS ambassador EMMANUEL AGIDA and I also won a cash price for being able to summarize what one of the speakers taught. Innovation is truly that conference that takes you from 1-100. I'm looking forward to this year's edition ❤",
